STEP 1: Create Project Folder

Purpose:
This step creates the main project directory and required subfolders to properly organize all cryptography components.

Commands:
mkdir Secure-Data-Exchange-Crypto
cd Secure-Data-Exchange-Crypto
mkdir PKI Encryption Digital-Signature SSL-TLS Documentation Documentation/Screenshots


STEP 2: PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

Definition:
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework used to generate, manage, store, and validate digital certificates and cryptographic keys.
It is mainly used for authentication, trust establishment, and secure communication.

2.1 Create CA (Certificate Authority)

Definition:
A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues and signs digital certificates.
It verifies identities and ensures trust between communicating parties.

Commands:
cd PKI
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ca.crt


2.2 Create Server Certificate

Definition:
A server certificate is used to identify a server and enable encrypted communication with clients.

Commands:
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365 -sha256


2.3 Create Client Certificate

Definition:
A client certificate is used to verify the identity of a client when connecting to a secure server.

Commands:
openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365 -sha256


STEP 3: Symmetric Encryption (AES)

Definition:
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm used to protect sensitive data.
The same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Commands:
cd ../Encryption
echo "This is confidential data for secure exchange" > plaintext.txt
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.txt
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted.txt -out decrypted.txt


STEP 4: Digital Signature

Definition:
A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that ensures message integrity and verifies the sender's identity.
It also provides non-repudiation, meaning the sender cannot deny sending the message.

Commands:
cd ../Digital-Signature
echo "This message must be authenticated" > message.txt
sha256sum message.txt > hash.txt
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ../PKI/client.key -out signature.sig message.txt
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify <(openssl x509 -in ../PKI/client.crt -pubkey -noout) -signature signature.sig message.txt


STEP 5: SSL / TLS Secure Communication

Definition:
SSL/TLS is a security protocol used to encrypt data transmitted over a network.
It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication between the client and server.

Commands:
cd ../SSL-TLS

TLS Server:
openssl s_server -cert ../PKI/server.crt -key ../PKI/server.key -CAfile ../PKI/ca.crt -accept 8443

TLS Client (new terminal):
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -cert ../PKI/client.crt -key ../PKI/client.key -CAfile ../PKI/ca.crt
